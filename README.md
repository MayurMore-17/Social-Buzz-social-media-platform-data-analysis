“Social Buzz” is social media platform where people uploads and react to another's uploads.
“Social Buzz” is a rapidly expanding  unicom in the technology space that needs to quickly adjust to it’s global reach. 
Accenture has started working on the following activities during three month POC:-
An examination of Social Buzz’s use of big data.
Strategies for prosperous initial public offering (IOP) .
An examination to determine the top 5 content categories on Social Buzz.

In recent years, the customers has grown to an enormous extent and they lack internal resources to manage it.
Every day, Social Buzz receives over 100,00 post, totalling 36,500,000 post annually. Since all of the content is unstructured, it might be challenging to make it sense of it all.
them our task are:
1. Combining the table form the Cleaned Data Set.
2. An Analysis of their content categories that identifies the top five with the highest total popularity.

Insights are:
1. Unique Categories are - 16
2. Top 5 Categories are - Animal, Science, Healthy Eating, Technology, Food
3. Category With Highest Score - Animal with 68624
4. Month with Most Post - May

Animals and Science are two most popular content categories, this sows that people enjoy “real-life” and “factual” content the most. So I would recommended to Social Buzz keep creating more contents related to these two categories.

Food is common theme with the top 5 categories with “Healthy Eating” ranking as one of the highest. This may give an indication to an audience within Social Buzz userbase.
